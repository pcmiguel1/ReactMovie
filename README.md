## Framework
Find your next movie or create your watchlist with this App. It include reviews, rating, actors and anything you need to know about the movie. This application will help users find their next movie to watch by showing helpful stats. In this project I am using Imdb API to get the movies and all the information.

## Main scenario

-   [ ] User can see all the latest movie on the front page
-   [ ] User scroll down to see all other movies according to release date
-   [ ] User can click on any movie to go their own separate page that contains all the information about that movie (movie ratings, actors present, about)

## Secondary scenario

-   [ ] User can review movies
-   [ ] User can create their own watch list
-   [ ] User can create an account
